### 2️⃣ Identify Forgeable Admin Cookie

Observed the following  request and cookie in the request:
we can see a value in cookie Admin=False means, authorization is manage in client-side


This indicates that admin authorization is controlled client-side.

### 3️⃣ Privilege Escalation (Repeater)

Modified the cookie in Burp Repeater:

```
Admin=false → Admin=true
```

This granted access to the admin panel at `/admin`.

```

### 4️⃣ Automate with Match & Replace

Configured Burp to automatically modify requests so when each request go through burpsuite it's automaticly set the value Admin=True
go into proxy setting->
**Proxy → Options → Match and Replace**->click add and then

* **Match field:** `Admin=false`
* **Replace field:** `Admin=true`
